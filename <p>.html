    <i>Future: </i>In my career, I have been fortunate enough to find amazing and caring advisors and collaborators who have collectively shaped my interests, and 
    given me opportunities to tackle interesting questions.
    I try to optimize for long-term collaborations and mentorship. My academic tree can be found below. In terms of work, 
    I often think about the implications of my research, and I hope to eventually be able to do something that makes some difference in the world --  
    the world where impact is not just measured by citations.
